# Exploration

Exploring different hypotheses and issues with the data for the DrivenData Water Supply Forecast Rodeo.  Please track open questions, literature reviews, key hydrological terminology, and potential solutions to the challenge here.

### Open Questions

**Data**
- Why is the training data annual and the forecast format is monthly? Is this a mistake?
- Is it better to transform the output variable to be percent change from average to account for gauge-specific variation not in the data?
- Are there any open source data sources on land use/land use change that we can use?

**Models**
- What is the M4 model that has been used in the past? How can we improve on its predictions and explainability?
